                    This is the section where I will be describing myself in a thorough but very brief sort of way. I am not one to name my qualities but this is very necessary for this part of the website.
                    <br><br>
                    So here we go
                    <br><br>
                    I am very interested in learning and getting accustomed with things. It is a very indescribable ‘lust'(taking away the negative connotation of the word lust). Since I was small i would always find myself looking for something new to learn. I eventually found my way to technology.
                    <br><br>
                    For me it started with my mothers laptop. It was always such an interesting experience to explore the laptop. I did my utmost best to always try and explore its many features. This might have lead to me crashing the laptop a few times but even though I crashed it I always came back.

                    Eventually life took its toll ( I didn’t die obviously) but slowly slowly the fire, rather the thirst for knowledge simmered down.
                    <br><br>
                    Until matric came. Matric was a… Well it depends which part of matric we are talking about. The friends, the experiences, the marks. But anyway, matric was really interesting because this was where <a href="#">the fire started again</a>. But it didn’t start in an intentional way. I heard a quote and instantly, two parts just connected and the fire was lite once again.
                    <br><br>
                    From there I pursued the answer to every question I had at the time. And Yoh! I must say I really enjoyed learning, understanding and applying this new found knowledge.

                One thing lead to the next, I did a few career tests and at that point I knew I wanted to study the brain. (That didn’t end up happening)
                    <br><br>
                Now looking back I see why it wouldn’t have worked out. Theory with now practical work for more than two years would’ve killed me.
                    <br><br>
                So I took a second approach. IT?
                    <br><br>
                At the time I just jumped into it but quickly gained a new found interest in it. It became one of my favourite things to learn about. Slowly slowly I became more familiar and eventually came to love coding and programming.
